# Search form & result renderer for Symfony2

XiSearchBundle provides simple way to display your search data when you do not know exactly what
kind of data to expect. 

You can use XiSearchBundle with any searchengine as XiSearchBundle provides you interfaces that your 
final search data object structure must implement.


## Integration to ElasticSearch

Probably most easiest way to use this bundle is to use it with ElasticSearch because XiSearchBundle provides you
premade implementation for it. This however requires [FOQElasticaBundle](https://github.com/Exercise/FOQElasticaBundle) to work.
